## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the project repository from a version control system like Git.
 
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies for the backend and frontend.
```bash
cd <project_directory>

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
3. ***Set up the backend***: Create a .env file in the backend directory to store your environment variables, such as database connection details or API keys. Start the backend server by running the following command in the backend directory:
```
npm start
```

4. ***Set up the frontend***: In the frontend directory, create a .env file if required to set environment-specific variables. Start the development server for the frontend by running the following command in the frontend directory:
```
npm start
```

5. Connect to MongoDB: Ensure that you have a MongoDB server running. You can either set up a local MongoDB instance or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. Update the MongoDB connection details in the backend's .env file.

6. Access the application: Once the backend and frontend servers are running without any errors, you can access your MERN application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified).
